# Database Gateway

This service provides a unified web interface for secure, controlled access to company databases. It enables employees
to run queries on `production` databases while enforcing access control (`ACL`) policies. For example, team leads may
have permissions to execute both `SELECT` and `INSERT` queries on certain tables, while other team members are
restricted to read-only (`SELECT`) access. This approach ensures that database interactions are managed safely and
that each userâ€™s access is tailored to their role and responsibilities.

## Quickstart with example setup

Run commands to get a local dbgw instance with 3 postgres.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kazhuravlev/database-gateway.git
cd database-gateway/example
docker compose up --pull always --force-recreate -d
open 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
# Username: test@example.com
# Password: password
```

You will see only 2 instances from 3 postgres instances (`local-1`, `local-2`,`local-3`) because ACL is applied to test
user. ACLs stored in [config.json](example/config.json).

Choose `local-1`, put this query `select id, name from clients` and click `Run` ![pic2_run.png](example/pic2_run.png)
