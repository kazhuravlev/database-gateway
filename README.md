This service provides a unified web interface for secure, controlled access to company databases. It enables employees
to run queries on `production` databases while enforcing access control (`ACL`) policies. For example, team leads may
have permissions to execute both `SELECT` and `INSERT` queries on certain tables, while other team members are
restricted to read-only (`SELECT`) access. This approach ensures that database interactions are managed safely and
that each userâ€™s access is tailored to their role and responsibilities.

## Architecture Overview

This application acts as a secure gateway to multiple PostgreSQL instances, allowing authenticated users to run approved
queries through a unified web interface, with fine-grained ACLs controlling access.

### Components

1. **Local PostgreSQL Database**:
    - Stores query results, user profiles, and ACLs.
    - Acts as a cache for query results, allowing unique links for debugging without re-execution.

2. **Remote PostgreSQL Instances**:
    - Host production data and are accessed only through the app.
    - Queries are run only if authorized by ACLs, limiting access to specific users, tables, and query types.

3. **OIDC Authentication**:
    - Users authenticate via an external OIDC provider.
    - User roles are mapped to ACLs, defining what queries each user can run.

4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
    - Define user permissions at the instance, table, and query type levels.
    - Stored in the local database, restricting queries based on user identity.

5. **Web Interface**:
    - Provides login, query submission, and result viewing.
    - Shows error feedback for unauthorized or restricted queries.

### Flow of Operations

1. **Authentication**: Users log in via OIDC, and their identity maps to ACL permissions.
2. **Query Submission**: Authorized queries are checked against ACLs, then run on remote instances.
3. **Result Caching**: Results are stored locally with unique links for easy access and debugging.

This architecture ensures secure, controlled access to production data, balancing usability with data protection.

## Quickstart with example setup

Run commands to get a local dbgw instance with 3 postgres.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kazhuravlev/database-gateway.git
cd database-gateway/example
docker compose up --pull always --force-recreate -d
open 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
# Admin: admin@example.com password
# User1: user1@example.com password
```

You will see only 2 instances from 3 postgres instances (`local-1`, `local-2`,`local-3`) because ACL is applied to test
user. ACLs stored in [config.json](example/config.json).

Choose `local-1`, put this query `select id, name from clients` and click `Run` ![pic2_run.png](example/pic2_run.png)
